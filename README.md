# SEO Text Helper

SEO Text Helper is a React application that assists in optimizing SEO text by providing keyword suggestions and character count tracking. It allows users to add keywords, compare them with the entered text, and provides a progress bar indicating the character count status. The application also offers a "Copy to Clipboard" feature for easy copying of the optimized text.
